# ShutTheBox
Game of Shut the Box, using PyQt5  

I'm a GCSE student, so feel free to ignore this as it is not likely to be particularly worthwhile: just a small project.  
That being said, feel free to comment, though this probably won't be updated much.  

# For use
You will need:  
* Python 3 installed, preferably 3.7. If it is not installed, follow these steps for Linux
> sudo apt-get install python3.7

* PyQt5 installed. if it is not installed, follow these steps for Linux
> sudo apt-get install python3-pip
> pip3 install PyQt5

# Rules
* First you roll the dice
* Then you flip at least one switch to be down
  * The switch/es has/ve to correspond to one of the dice, or both added together
* If all the switches are down, you win
* If there are no moves that can be made in the turn, you lose

***Feel free to edit the code in any clones that you download if you so wish***
